NAME
    WWW::Finger - get useful data from e-mail addresses

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Finger;
      my $finger = WWW::Finger->new("joe@example.com");
      if (defined $finger)
      {
        print $finger->name . "\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module is *not* an implementation of the finger protocol (RFC
    1288). Use Net::Finger for that. Instead it is a set of implementations
    of *other* methods for getting information from an e-mail address, or
    e-mail like identifier. This package includes four such implementations,
    and it's pretty easy to create your own additional implementations:

    *       WebFinger

    *       Fingerpoint

    *       MetaCPAN API for cpan.org addresses

    *       Unnamed finger protocol described on bitworking.org

  Constructor
    *       "new"

              $finger = WWW::Finger->new($identifier);

            Creates a WWW::Finger object for a particular identifier. Will
            return undef if no implemetation is able to handle the
            identifier

  Object Methods
    Any of these methods can return undef if the appropriate information is
    not available. The "name", "mbox", "homepage", "weblog", "image" and
    "key" methods work in both scalar and list context. Depending on which
    implementation was used by "WWW::Finger->new", the object may also have
    additional methods. Consult the documentation of the various
    implementations for details.

    "name"
        The person's name (or handle/nickname).

    "mbox"
        The person's e-mail address (including "mailto:").

    "homepage"
        The person's personal homepage.

    "weblog"
        The person's blog. (There may be some overlap with "homepage".)

    "image"
        An avatar, photo or other image depicting the person.

    "key"
        The URL of the person's GPG/PGP public key.

    "webid"
        A URI uniquely identifying the person. See
        <http://esw.w3.org/topic/WebID>.

    "endpoint"
        A SPARQL Protocol endpoint which may provide additional data about
        the person. (See RDF::Query::Client.)

    "graph"
        An RDF::Trine::Model object holding data about the person. (See
        RDF::Trine.)
